## Overview

This organisation holds free open-source projects released under `tech.harmonysoft.oss` root package. Mostly they are jvm (java/kotlin) utilities, but going forward something new might grow here as well.

Contribution is welcome, if you feel that some cool feature/product is missing, feel free to create corresponding ticket or, even better, a pull request.
